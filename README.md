# kv

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seekerror/kv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seekerror/kv)

KV provides unified key-value stores across various storage backends, as either
RO or RW, for convenience and flexibility. The keys use an imposed
"/"-directory structure for filesystem-like exploration. Implementations
should have the most obvious layout and no extra metadata to allow the
abstraction to apply widely.
